description: The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and regulatory
  compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware Security Module
  (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With CloudHSM, you control the encryption
  keys and cryptographic operations performed by the HSM.AWS and AWS Marketplace partners
  offer a variety of solutions for protecting sensitive data within the AWS platform,
  but for applications and data subject to rigorous contractual or regulatory requirements
  for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection is sometimes necessary. Until
  now, your only option was to store the sensitive data (or the encryption keys protecting
  the sensitive data) in your on-premises datacenters. Unfortunately, this either
  prevented you from migrating these applications to the cloud or significantly slowed
  their performance. The AWS CloudHSM service allows you to protect your encryption
  keys within HSMs designed and validated to government standards for secure key management.
  You can securely generate, store, and manage the cryptographic keys used for data
  encryption such that they are accessible only by you. AWS CloudHSM helps you comply
  with strict key management requirements without sacrificing application performance.The
  AWS CloudHSM service works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). CloudHSM instances
  are provisioned inside your VPC with an IP address that you specify, providing simple
  and private network connectivity to your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.
  Placing CloudHSM instances near your EC2 instances decreases network latency, which
  can improve application performance. AWS provides dedicated and exclusive (single
  tenant) access to CloudHSM instances, isolated from other AWS customers. Available
  in multiple Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), AWS CloudHSM allows you to add
  secure and durable key storage to your applications.
